To simplify **HR management**, I developed the Wave HR system, which streamlines leave requests, conflict resolution, and administrative form generation. Built with [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), this system improves efficiency and reduces errors, offering a scalable solution for HR teams to manage their workforce effectively.
