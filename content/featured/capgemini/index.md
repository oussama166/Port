<p>
This project focused on enhancing quality assurance for a <b>critical back-office application</b> used for managing vehicle orders.
</p>
My primary contribution was to <a href="#">automate functional tests</a> using <b><i>Java</i></b> and <b><i>Selenium WebDriver</i></b>, ensuring robust non-regression testing.
I also developed an innovative <a href="#">automation tool to streamline</a> test user identifier management, specifically by <b>extracting expired credentials from Excel files and automating notifications for regeneration</b>. This significantly improved testing efficiency and reliability.
